            <h2>What Is a Front-End Developer?</h2>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              <b>Front-end web development</b>, also known as client-side
              development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript
              for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and
              interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front
              end development is that the tools and techniques used to create
              the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer
              needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.
            </p>
            <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
              The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users
              open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy
              to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that
              users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes
              and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into
              consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to
              ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers
              (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and
              different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning
              on the side of the developer.
